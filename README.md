## why do this?
Well, the value in version control is **astronomical**; I would like to highlight a couple of key points as to why it is the *bees knees* and why you should implement it in your developer practices.

### TL;DR
By using a version control system (such as **Git**) we are able to keep track of every change to the code. We are able to revert changes if mistakes are made and collaborate easily with other developers using branches.

### 1. We all make mistakes
It's just part of human nature, we can't avoid it, so let's safegaurd ourselves and set us up for success by being able to turn back to clock if a mistake is made (**it will happen, *trust me*.**)

### 2. Collaboration made easy
We can collaborate with other developers by creating branches (*no, we do not plant seeds and wait for the tree to grow to eventually get a branch*), which creates a copy of the **main** branch at that point in time.

By using a branch, we can create a new feature which won't disrupt the **main** branch, also known as the production branch which is what end users see. When the new feature is ready, we can merge our changes back into **main** as documented in the above image.
